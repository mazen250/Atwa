          <span className="hi"> Hi! I’m coach Atwa!</span> <br />
          I have studied nutrition at the University of Victoria, British
          Columbia, Canada.
          <br />
          Throughout the past years of my online personal training, I have
          educated and supported many people through their fitness journey and I
          believe that this is only the beginning.
          <br /> I’m recognized as one of the well-known influential trainers in
          Egypt and the Middle East, starting slowly to have reached Europe, the
          United States, and the entire World.
          <br /> I’ve made it my personal mission to help as many people as
          possible to achieve their ideal level of fitness and to feel more
          confident and happy. <br /> Educate people on the many wrong fitness
          perceptions and raise more awareness of the mystical ways of losing
          weight and how dangerous this could have an impact on health.
          <br /> helping people understand the science of how the body works and
          hammering on the fact that what works for you doesn’t work for someone
          else. <br /> My programs are flexible, so you can choose whether you
          want to work out at home or in the gym! You’ll learn how to train to
          increase your fitness and strength through regular workouts. <br /> My
          programs also grow with you, so you’ll always be progressing. YOU ARE
          WAY STRONGER THAN WHAT YOU THINK!! I DREAM OF MAKING THE WORLD STRONG
